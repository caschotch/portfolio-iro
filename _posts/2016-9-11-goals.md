title: My goals as a Frontend developer
---
I started this program with Bloc thinking I would just use it to get a new job in the tech world. But lately I have a switch that went off, I not only want to get a decent job and career but once I do I will be using my skills to contribute to open source projects to try and help Government. I truly believe that our Government is wasting resources be it in time, and money that from an updated Technological standpoint will correct. Hopefully I can make some small impact that will better someone else's life.
