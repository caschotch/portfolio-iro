title: My experience so far with Bloc.
---

Been at this for 6 weeks now and I have to say it has been transformative. I can now write and read code in way I have never been able too. The courses, and mentorship, has led me to new experiences with seeing how something is done and why it was done that way. I tried the Treehouse, Codecademy, Free code camp way before and while they maybe good for some I just wanted to ensure I had a good learning structure with someone I can go to that could explain it to me with real world examples. Can't wait to get through the projects and start on backend.
