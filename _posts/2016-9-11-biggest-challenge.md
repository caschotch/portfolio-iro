title: Biggest Challenge
---

Considering I'm over 40, and have a full time job, I seriously thought that would be my 2 biggest challenges. At this time I have learned that age doesn't matter in a way you may think. I will admit I have some preconceived notions and will sometimes push them in such a way so to prevent me from fully accepting something. I have had to learn to slow down, reread something 2-3 or more times to truly get what they are asking for, and why.

Point in fact is that I hate networking. I just don't like being in crowds, this could be from me being a Veteran, or just the way I have lived my life. Which has always been if I need something done I do it, I don't ask for help, don't request someone to look over my should to check on something I have done. I just do it.

This unfortunately has turned me into a introvert. Being an introvert isn't necessarily bad per se however when trying to break into a new industry you do need to shed a few protective layers to at least get your name out there. This is an ongoing challenge for me, and will be partially solved by keeping a 'blog'. Although I have never written about myself as I usually stay away from showing anything about my life I will assume it has merits besides advertising my inadequate skills.

It will be a learning experience that I will try and squeeze every bit out of.
